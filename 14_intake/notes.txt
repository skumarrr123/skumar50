DISCO:
* At first, the auth page was unable to load because there was no existing username in args. In order for the function with route 'auth' to run, it has to have a username in order to print "Waaaa hooo HAAAH"
* First, we uncommented all of the tags to see which part of the code
would throw an error. In doing so, a BadRequestKeyError is thrown
stating that 'username' isn't a key.
* This would suggest that args is a dictionary of request and 'username'
is not a valid key in args.
* We also found out that uncommenting this single line was the issue for 
both functions, supporting our theories on the first discovery.
* ONLY when you submit an username does the line actually work, thus meaning
that the input was added to the args dictionary and thus produces a value for
the key.
* In HTML the tag form is used with action="/auth" to push the route to
/auth after hitting submit on the home page.
* "auth?username=sdadsa&sub1=Submit" -> the hyperlink changed to that
when we typed in a username, "sdadsa". I think this represents a logic line,
where if auth is validated, username should have a value and sub1 should
equal Submit.

Q/C/C:
* We weren't really sure what "#, methods=['GET', 'POST'])" meant as we tried
uncommenting it to no avail. It just created a new error saying that
it needed to be after a decorator.
* The text below was prompted after I uncommented only the auth route function without 
the error. I did my best to cross-correlate with each method. 

* How is this information useful to us as developers? It just seems like
blurry scrambled words and techy stuff at this point.

OTHER?
* What is PyCache? I think cache is like the data that is temporarily 
stored using RAM (maybe), so maybe PyCache is python's cache??
* Request module is used for form submission.
* Can I have multiple functions with an app.route('/'). I've always
been curious whether or not this was possible
