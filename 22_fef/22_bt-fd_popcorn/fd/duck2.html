<H2> Hi everyone, this is Pomegranate</H2>
<p> Pomegranate was born in the magical forest of Mariland. Her grandmother made her a nice little hood that she wore everywhere. One day, as she was happily skipping to her grandmother's house, she tripped and fell and her hood got soaked in a puddle of pomegranate juice. It's now stained forever! Terrified of telling her grandmother what happened, she ran away to New York City and now sits next to me when I code. </p>
