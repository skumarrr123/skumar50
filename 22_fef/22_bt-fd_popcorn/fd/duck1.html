<H2> Hi everyone, this is Au Man</H2>
<p> Au Man has seen a great many things, traveling on my backpack. He's witnessed the peaks of the Rockies and the Alps, the depths of the Grand Canyon, the blistering heat in Texas, and the freezing cold in Canada. However, nothing compares to his fate. Once upon a time, the Au Man met a great prophet, who told him he was the chosen one, destined to bring peace to all lego kind. While many don't believe in the prophecy, I believe Au Man can change the world/bring balance to the force/destroy the ring/defeat. </p>
