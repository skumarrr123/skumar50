Time spent: 

DISCO:
- had to enable several settings for copilot to analyze code
- takes a while to load
- had many mistakes, but was able to revise them once prompted, did not break on itself
- issues with flash messages, orginally not display them, then displayed on web page as opposed to as a pop down message
- delays with presentation of flash messsages
- no css/design elements

- each file has a different amount of versions as they can be updated seperately
